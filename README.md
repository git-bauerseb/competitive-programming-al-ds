# Competitive Programming - AL & DS

This repository contains some useful algorithms and data structures specifically used in competitive programming tasks such as [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com), [CodeJamp](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), [Kickstart](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart), etc.

Don't expect a complete and bug-free implementation as most implements were not (fully) tested.
